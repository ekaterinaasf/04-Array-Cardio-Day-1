# 04-Array-Cardio-Day-1: development strategy

Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

> - We need to create 2 files for the site itself: for DOM and for script.
> - We need to create 2 other files describing the project: Readme.md and development-strategy.md.

## 1. User Story: Create index.html

> - We need only a block with the title
> - We need to create a separate branch `index` for index.html

## 2. User Story: Create script.js

> - We need data to work with: object `inventors`, array `people`.
> - Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's using `Array.prototype.filter()`.
> - Receive an array of the inventor first and last names using `Array.prototype.map()`.
> - Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest using `Array.prototype.sort()`
> - Calculate how many years did all the inventors live using `Array.prototype.reduce()`
> - Sort the inventors by years lived using `Array.prototype.sort()`
> - Sort the people alphabetically by last name using `Array.prototype.sort()`
> - Sum up the instances of each of these data.

## 4. User Story: Create Readme.md

> - We need to create readme.md describing the structure of all files inside this project.

## 5. User Story: Create development-strategy.md

> - We need to create development-strategy.md describing the set of user stories in which we divided an entire project.
